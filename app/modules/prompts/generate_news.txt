Translate the content into English and summarize it in the style of a professional news article.

Write the result so that it:
- Reads naturally as a native English news report
- Uses clear paragraph separation with **two line breaks between paragraphs**

Do NOT include any <img> or <caption> tags — the system will handle that automatically.

Output your final result strictly in the following XML structure:

<Title>English headline</Title>

<Article>
[Main article body — written in English, with paragraph breaks using two line spaces]
</Article>

Do NOT include explanations or commentary.

- Uses clear paragraph separation with **two line breaks between paragraphs**
- Places the image (if any) at the top of the article with a caption below it in this exact format:
  <img src="{{image_url}}" alt="article image"/>
  <caption>Image source: {{image_url}}</caption>

Output your final result strictly in the following XML structure:

<Title>English headline</Title>

<Article>
